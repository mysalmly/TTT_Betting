# Betting Tic Tac Toe Game

Tic Tac Toe but with a twist!

- After connecting their crypto wallets, users will be able to bet a certain amount of DOT tokens. Both bets will be locked into a smart contract. At the end of the game the Tokens locked inside the contract will be transferred to the winners account in full! (We won't charge you for using our platform, revenue will be made through ads or other ways)

- Playing the same old games all the time can easily get boring, but what if there was a risk? It's proven that the human brain enjoys challenges more when there are risks involved. So taking a traditional game we'd normally play in class as kids, we decided to enhance it to be more fun and suitable for the new web3 world! Introducing TTT Bets, a platform that allows users to play TicTacToe against one another while risking their DOT tokens.

- Gear's ability to work with smart contracts and web3 applications helped us the most with this project.
